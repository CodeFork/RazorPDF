RazorPDF
==============

RazorPDF is a simple project that makes it a breeze to create PDFs using the Razor view engine. Since Razor is really a template syntax, it can do lot more than just generate HTML.  RazorPDF uses it to generate iText XML.  Then using the iTextSharp library, we turn that iText XML into a PDF to return.  The end result is a easy to use, clean method for generating PDFs.
